# Linked Data Reactor

Linked Data Reactor aims to build a set of reactive and reusable UI components to facilitate building Linked Data applications. LD-Reactor utilizes Facebook's ReactJS components, Flux architecture and Yahoo!'s Fluxible framework for isomorphic web applications. LD-Reactor applies the idea of component-based application development into RDF data model to enhance user interfaces to view, browse and edit Linked Data. It also exploits Semantic-UI framework for providing flexible UI themes.
