#TODO list
- add pagination to resource list
- enable retrieving resources with multi type
- add examples for AggregateData
- minify & uglify js files
- standardize component Names (results in SW components when used with an ontology)
- automatic selection of right components (semantic annotation can be used)
- allow multiple views/edit tabs on each property
- think about cross property values (in charts)
