    <div class="description">
        In recent years, we have seen quite some progress on the backend side of the Semantic Web (i.e. in representing, extracting and storing Linked Data, querying, reasoning over data, interlinking data, etc.). However, little attention is paid to the end-user applications of SW and Linked Data.
        Currently, SW user interfaces are not standardized and often do not function consistent with user expectations. Inconsistent UIs are hard for users to master and will impel a cognitive load for the users. For example, we usually see a same control used to perform different actions on different applications, which makes it impossible for users to apply what they have learned and predict the outcome. LD-R exploits <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">ReactJS</a> to enable building reusable UI components for SW applications. Focusing on UI components, will enable developers to concentrate more on the standardization of SW UIs and applying best practices on SW applications.

LD-R offers the first <b>Isomorphic Semantic Web Application</b>. Thanks to the underlying <a href="http://fluxible.io/">Fluxible</a> framework, developers only need to write code for components once and then can run the code both on the client and server side. In addition to reducing development time, the final application will be also SEO friendly.

        LD-R atomizes RDF model into small units which will hide the complexity of dealing with RDF data. It allows developers to focus on compartments and can reuse existing Web components within SW applications.

LD-R proposes the culture of component-based application development. Harnessing the power of existing package managers, users can easily share and resue their components together with their configs.

        LD-R exploits <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic-UI</a> framework for styling components. This will enable developers to take benefit of a variety of css frameworks for theming their applications.
