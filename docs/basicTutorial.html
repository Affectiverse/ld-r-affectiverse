Basic Tutorial

<h2>Before you start...</h2>
<p> 
Before you start this tutorial, please make sure that you have followed the instructions on our <a href="quickstart.html"> Quick Start</a> page and have installed everything which is required for this tutorial.
</p>

<h2>What is it about?</h2>
<p> 
In this tutorial, we will build an LD-R application on top of the <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> knowledge graph -- extracted structred information from Wikipedia. The tutorial will show how basic configurations in the platform work to view, edit and browse Linked Data.
</p>

<h2>Let's start!</h2>
Go to the directoy where you have installed your LD-R instance and open your favorite code editor (I usually use <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom editor</a> which brings a set of nice features for Web development and it itself is built with React technology. To launch the Atom editor, I simply run <code class="ui label">atom .</code> on my project directory.).
