Basic Tutorial

<h2>Before you start...</h2>
<p> 
Before you start this tutorial, please make sure that you have followed the instructions on our <a href="quickstart.html"> Quick Start</a> page and have installed everything which is required for this tutorial.
</p>

<h2>What is it about?</h2>
<p> 
In this tutorial, we will build a LD-R application on top of the <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a> knowledge graph -- extracted structred information from Wikipedia. 
The tutorial will show how the basic configurations in LD-R can be applied to view, edit and browse Linked Data.
</p>

<h2>Let's start!</h2>
Go to the directoy where you have installed your LD-R instance and open your favorite code editor (I usually use <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom editor</a> which brings a set of nice features for Web development and it per se is built with React technology. To launch the Atom editor, I simply run <code class="ui label">atom .</code> on my project directory.).
<p>
  In order to develop and see the results in parallel, run the <code class="ui label">npm run dev</code> command. If you are a windows user, try <code class="ui label">npm run dev:windows</code> instead. This command will start the Node server and will watch you code for possible changes. It will thereby refresh the pages/components automatically without re-running the command or refrshing the browser page. 
</p>
<p>
  Once the Node server is on, If you now go to the <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser you should see the home page of the LD-R:
</p>
<div>
    <img class="ui centered image" src="/assets/img/basicTutorial/t1.png" alt="t1" />
</div>
<p>
  If you click on the <span class="ui primary label">Datasets</span>, you should see the following message: 
</p>
<div>
    <img class="ui centered image" src="/assets/img/basicTutorial/t2.png" alt="t2" />
</div>
