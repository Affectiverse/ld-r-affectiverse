WYSIWYQ  (What You See Is What You Query)
</h2>

<p>
  Existing Linked Data browsing user interfaces (UIs) allow users who are not familiar with Semantic Web technologies to explore interlinked datasets by generating SPARQL queries behind the scenes.
This is analogous to the well-known WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) paradigm, which generates the required markup in the background based on the user interactions.
Nonetheless, and contrarily to the WYSIWYG approach where users are enabled to switch between the source code and the UI, there is no alternative in Linked Data browsing UIs to generate the browsing UI based on a given SPARQL query.
  WYSIWYQ (What You See Is What You Query) is a novel approach that allows people to interactively visualize a given SPARQL query as a browsing UI, which can be further enriched or re-purposed by users.
  WYSIWYQ aims to provide a two-way binding between SPARQL queries and RDF-based faceted browsing environments. <a href="http://research.ld-r.org/papers/wysiwyq.pdf">Read More...</a>
