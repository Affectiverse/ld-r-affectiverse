<p>
    Serendipity, the art of making an unsought finding plays also an important role in the emerging field of data science, allowing the discovery of interesting and valuable facts not initially sought for.
    Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web which is powered by the Follow-Your-Nose effect, provides already a rich source for serendipity.
    The serendipity most often takes place when browsing data.
    Therefore, flexible and intuitive browsing user interfaces which support serendipity triggers such as enigmas, anomalies, and novelties, can increase the likelihood of serendipity on LOD.
    FERASAT is a novel faceted browsing environment powered by the LD-R framework.
    It supports a set of serendipity-fostering design patterns to provide an adaptive multigraph-based faceted browsing interface to catalyze serendipity on Semantic Web and LOD environments. <a href="http://research.ld-r.org/papers/three-pincess-LinkedData.pdf">Read more...</a>
