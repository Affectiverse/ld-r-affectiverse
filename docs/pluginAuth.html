<p>
    LD-R provides a plugin for authentication and user access control. Since LD-R stores users as resources in the triple store, you need to first insert user's data into your data store under a graph name. You then need to set this dataset URI as <span class="ui label">authDatasetURI</span> in your general.js config file. There is already a sample schema available for admin user at <a href="https://github.com/ali1k/ld-r/blob/master/plugins/authentication/schema/users.ttl"><span class="ui label">plugins/authentication/schema/users.ttl</span></a> that can be used. To enable user authentication, you need to set the value for <span class="ui label">enableAuthentication</span> to '1'. You can also setup <span class="ui label">enableUserConfirmation</span> to control user confirmation after registration. Each registered user will create a new resource which can be viewed, browsed and edited like other resources in the system.

    LD-R defines a view and edit access strategy for users. Access levels are based on the scopes defined for reactors. A Super user will have access to all levels and can configure which user has view/edit access to which level (e.g. User X can only edit dataset D1 or User Y can only edit Resource R or User Z can only edit Property P1 in Resource R1). The following figure depicts these user access levels:
